# Pair programming 

Pair programming is having two devs working on the same problem at the same computer. One person is the driver; he will be in charge of writing the code. The second dev will be the navigator, reviewing the code written, pitching ideas for upcoming problems, and looking things up that will help the driver.

Pair programming improves code quality, having a navigator eases the workload on the driver. It also improves your ability to verbalize your thoughts, something that is tough for antisocial devs lolol
